Here's my wip souls game style "engine" if you can call it that, very much wip, i'll be posting regular updates as long as i have motivation to work on this, currently very limited, the only thing you can really do is just add areas that display the name of the area, other features include calcview hook that controls third person which i will use for the character, it's gonna be a hologram instead of an actual player etc, also player light, it's very dim, just like in dark souls 3, you can see around yourself in dark with it, also debug mode, simply toss the "gametests" folder into garrys mod/garrys mod/data/starfall/ and spawn the chip named "spawn", walk into any of the zones and it should display the name of the zone on your screen
